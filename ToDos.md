# AI-Native JSON CMS with FastAPI + MCP

## Vision

Build a dynamic JSON-driven CMS platform using FastAPI and PostgreSQL where entities are defined using configuration files and CRUD APIs are generated automatically.

The platform will later expose all operations through an MCP server, making the backend directly operable by AI agents.

This project serves as:

- A FastAPI architecture playground
- A dynamic metadata-driven backend
- A foundation for AI-native SaaS products
- A reusable business application boilerplate
